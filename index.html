                        <a href="#Leo">Leo</a> and <a href="#Liza">Liza</a> were born on August 8th, 2018 to their parents, Petrusha and Arina. They are a colorpoint siberian family, also called neva masquerades, and not only are they one of the most beautiful breeds with their piercing blue eyes and coloration, they are also extremely sweet, loving, and affectionate. They are literally angels on earth.

                    <p class="extra-margin">
                        The reason I know their parents is because of the cutest lil fairytale backstory: my mom was gifted her first cat, Petrusha, and she wanted another one to keep him company. She decided on a girl, Arina, and decided to let them have babies! They had a litter of six kittens, one of which tragically didn't make it because it was born with gastroschisis :( But the rest of the kittens made it! And they're happy and healthy. Two of Leo and Liza's siblings went to different homes, and Leo and Liza came home with me when they were four months old. Their littlest sibling, Glasha, still lives with her parents - and my parents - so she can keep Arina company.

                        I have never loved two creatures more in my entire life! And I am so happy to be their cat mama.
